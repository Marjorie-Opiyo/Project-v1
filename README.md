# Business Understanding
Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation which produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

To this end, I have been tasked with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
